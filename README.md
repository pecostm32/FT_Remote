All resources for upgrading an old 27MHz fischertechink remote control system to modern digital technology.

Owning two old fischertechnik remote control systems that have intermittent problems with transmissions I
decided to design a new digital system for it, reusing the old casings and joysticks.

Wrote about the journey on EEVBlog: https://www.eevblog.com/forum/projects/modernizing-old-fischertechnik-27mc-remote-control/

In this repository all parts of the project are made available.
