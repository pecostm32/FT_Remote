All resources for upgrading an old 27MHz fischertechink remote control system to modern digital technology.

Owning two old fischertechnik remote control systems that have intermittent problems with transmissions I
decided to design a new digital system for it, reusing the old casings and joysticks.

Wrote about the journey on EEVBlog: https://www.eevblog.com/forum/projects/modernizing-old-fischertechnik-27mc-remote-control/

In this repository all parts of the project are made available.

As per the lisence, I take no reponsability for what is in this repository. Use it at your own risk.

The source code for the firmware of both boards is based on shared files all included in the repository. It is fully
bare metal and no extras are needed. It may be that you have to tweak the makefile to make it work from command line
directly. I use netbeans 8.2.
